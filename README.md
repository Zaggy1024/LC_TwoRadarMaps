# TwoRadarMaps
TwoRadarMaps separates the radar map within the terminal from the radar map displayed on the screen at the front of the ship so that they can monitor the perspectives of different players/radar boosters. The `switch` command in the terminal will only have an effect on its own radar map.

When combined with the [Touchscreen mod](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/TheDeadSnake/Touchscreen/), those two players will both be able to disable turrets/mines, open/close doors, etc. without interfering with each other.

Additionally, as a side effect of confining the visibility of night vision lighting to the map radar cameras, the night vision will now function outside the facility:
