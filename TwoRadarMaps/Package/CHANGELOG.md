## Version 1.1.0
- Implemented an opt-in feature feature which allows the terminal to select from a list of customizable zoom levels.

## Version 1.0.2
- Render a separate instance of the fixed UI for the terminal map
  - This fixes an issue where the planet description and video would not display after initially loading into a save
  - If a mod is installed that keeps the terminal visible after exiting it, the "MONITORING: [player]" text will remain visible as well

## Version 1.0.1
- Track the visibility of the terminal contents so that the map continues updating if a mod forces it to remain visible

## Version 1.0.0
- Initial release
